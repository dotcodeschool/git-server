# Post-Receive Git Hook Script
# ----------------------------
# This post-receive hook script is designed to run on the server after a successful git push.
# It performs the following actions:
#
# 1. Displays an ASCII art of the logo for Dot Code School as the welcome banner.
# 2. Prints a custom welcome message to notify the user of a successful commit reception.
# 3. Retrieves the current working directory of the repository where the hook is executed.
# 4. Extracts the username and repository name from the directory path.
# 5. Constructs and displays the full URL of the repository based on extracted details.
#
# The script uses ANSI escape codes to colorize output:
# - GREEN for success messages.
# - BLUE, and ORANGE if needed for additional messages or alerts (currently not used in this script).
# - NC (No Color) resets the text color to default terminal color to avoid bleed-over of colors in terminal output.
#
# Usage: 
# This script should be placed in the 'hooks/post-receive' directory of a Git repository and made executable.
# It helps in providing immediate visual feedback to users who push to the repository, and constructs a URL that can be used for further automated tasks or logging.
#
# Note:
# Ensure the base URL ("https://gitserver.com/") is correctly configured to match your server's URL structure.
